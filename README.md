# Parking

This Arduino porject implements control of a parking with a capacity of 10 vehicles.

---
## Considerations
- It counts with a barrier for entry and a barrier for exit.
- The barrier motor need to be active for 3 secons to complete the movement.
- Each barrier have 2 sensors  which can be both active because of their disposition.
- The exit barrier counts with an extra sensor for the parking tiket.
- The project count with 3 buttons for start, stop, and reset the parking.
- It have 2 light signals to indicate if there is space or no

## Lenguage
